Hi, thanks for checking out my portfolio! This is a collection of my technical experiences, projects and personal tidbits of what's ongoing in my life. 

Built with react + vite, three.js, glsl and framer motion (still learning, lots of work left to be done on this), deployed with vercel. Check it out here and let me know what you think! &rarr; https://sabrinawang.ca/

The design is still a work in progress but I wanted to theme it like a café since I love baking, café hopping and trying all sorts of sweets around the world (also just an excuse for me to draw more desserts). 

To dos:
- [ ] add a cat
- [ ] make it so you can pet the cat
- [ ] fix animations for projects section
- [ ] dark mode improvement
